# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-19)

**Core value:** Every shared integration pattern is decided and implemented once, so child projects inherit correct, modern, community-quality code
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Scaffold Fixes

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 7 (Scaffold Fixes)
Plan: 0 of 2 in current phase
Status: Planned — ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-02-19 — Phase 1 planned: 2 plans in 1 wave, verification passed

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-roadmap]: All three child projects share the same 5 breaking defects — Phase 1 is correctness-only, no new features
- [Pre-roadmap]: Copier Jinja2/Python brace collision must be resolved before any .jinja Python files are written (Phase 2 prerequisite for all later phases)
- [Pre-roadmap]: Static path registration goes in `async_setup` (not `async_setup_entry`) to prevent duplicate registration on second config entry

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 4]: LitElement version (Lit 2.x vs 3.x) in HA 2025.7 needs confirmation at smoke-test time — extraction pattern works regardless but API differences may surface
- [Phase 1]: RESOLVED — Research confirmed: use `/{DOMAIN}/` prefix (not `/hacsfiles/`). `/hacsfiles/` is HACS-owned namespace for cards HACS downloads. Plan 01-01 updates const.py accordingly.

## Session Continuity

### Phase 1 Planning Summary
- **Research:** HIGH confidence on all 8 SCAF requirements (01-RESEARCH.md)
- **Plan 01-01 (Wave 1):** Fix integration core — __init__.py (async_setup + runtime_data), coordinator.py (async_get_clientsession), sensor.py (runtime_data access), const.py (URL prefix fix), hacs.json (version bump). Covers SCAF-01, 02, 04, 07, 08.
- **Plan 01-02 (Wave 1):** Fix config flow — unique_id + abort duplicate, connection validation stub, OptionsFlow base class, options flow strings. Covers SCAF-03, 05, 06.
- **Both plans are Wave 1 (parallel)** — disjoint file sets, no dependencies.
- **Verification:** Passed all 7 dimensions. No issues found.
- **No CONTEXT.md** — user chose to proceed without discuss-phase (Phase 1 is correctness-only with no design decisions).
