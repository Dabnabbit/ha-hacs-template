## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. validate.yml template structure
expected: `template/.github/workflows/validate.yml` exists and contains two separate jobs: `hassfest` (with checkout + hassfest action) and `hacs` (with hacs/action). Actions are SHA-pinned (long hex hashes, not version tags). File has `permissions: {}` and `ignore: brands`.
result: pass

### 2. Copier generates validate.yml in child project
expected: Running `copier copy` produces a child project with `.github/workflows/validate.yml` present — identical content to the template file (no Jinja substitution needed since it's a static file).
result: pass

### 3. Generated .gitignore includes test artifacts
expected: Generated child project `.gitignore` contains `.pytest_cache/`, `.coverage`, `coverage.xml`, `htmlcov/` entries alongside the original Python/IDE/OS exclusions (`__pycache__/`, `.vscode/`, `.DS_Store`, etc.).
result: pass

### 4. Generated README has HACS badge and project content
expected: Generated child project `README.md` shows a HACS badge image/link, installation instructions mentioning HACS, and a card usage section with the project's domain name substituted in (not raw Jinja variables).
result: pass

### 5. GitHub Actions: hassfest catches manifest errors
expected: Pushing a generated project to GitHub with a deliberately broken `manifest.json` (e.g., missing required field) causes the hassfest job to fail with a visible error identifying the manifest issue. The HACS job runs independently.
result: pass

### 6. GitHub Actions: both jobs pass on clean project
expected: Pushing a clean generated project (no modifications) to GitHub shows both hassfest and HACS validation jobs completing successfully with green checkmarks.
result: issue
reported: "hassfest fails: (1) http component used but not in manifest dependencies — template uses async_register_static_paths from homeassistant.components.http but manifest only lists frontend in dependencies. (2) CONFIG_SCHEMA not defined — config-entry-only integrations should set CONFIG_SCHEMA = cv.config_entry_only_config_schema. HACS fails on repo metadata (no topics/description) which is per-repo, not template."
